# Comparative Yield Models

This project is scaffolded for machine learning workflows using PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, and ConfigLM. The Python environment is cloned from an existing ML environment for consistency.

## Setup

- The `.venv` directory is a clone of `/home/matthew/Projects/reben-training-scripts/.venv`.
- All required ML packages are pre-installed.

## Usage

- Activate the virtual environment: `source .venv/bin/activate`
- Start developing your ML scripts in the `src/` directory (create it if needed).

## Main Libraries

- PyTorch
- Hugging Face Transformers
- ConfigLM
